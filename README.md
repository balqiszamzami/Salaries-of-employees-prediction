# Salaries of employees prediction

This is final project Statistics for Business in Pacmann course. In this project, there is a dataset that shows the salary a person has based on age, gender, education level, job title, and length of work experience. From the dataset, I want to know the influence of these factors on salary and predict someoneâ€™s salary.
